LinkedEarth: A community for the paleosciences.

LinkedEarth is a community of paleoscientists working to develop standards and software to enable paleoscience in the era of Big Data. This community produces data products and standards, software, cyberinfrastructure, and training opportunities.

LinkedEarth originated in 2016 through a grant from the National Science Foundation EarthCube program. The original goal of the project was to create a platform for the archival of paleoclimate dataset and to centralize the discussion about standardization of these datasets. Since then, the community has grown towards using these standards to build automated tools for the analysis of these datasets and other data products.

There is no formal registration for LinkedEarth. We hope that you will join this growing community because the tools we provide become part of your scientific workflow.
